# Twitter Bot

Welcome to the Twitter Bot project! This project allows you to easily automate post tweets through a Python script using the Twitter API and user tokens. You have the flexibility to customize and extend the bot's functionality using your own classes and functions. To get started, follow the instructions below.


## Prerequisites

Before using this Twitter bot, you need to have the following:

1. Python (>= 3.9)
2. Twitter Developer Account with a registered application
3. User tokens (Access Token and Access Token Secret) from your Twitter Developer Account

**Note:** Keep your Twitter API credentials confidential and avoid sharing them in public repositories.


## Customization

You can extend the functionality of the Twitter bot by modifying the existing classes and functions or adding your own. For example, you could implement functions to retweet, like, or reply to tweets based on certain criteria.
